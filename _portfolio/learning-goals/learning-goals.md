#### <a id="lg1"></a> Learning Goal 1: Reading and Writing are Integrated Activities

“Reading almost destroyed my life.”

This was how I started my Literacy Narrative, one of my first real college assignments, freshman year (Appendix 1). I had entered Hobart and William Smith in full knowledge of what letting yourself become immersed in the world of literature could do. Having read so much fiction, fantasy, really anything I could get my hands on in high school, I realized that when it came to the really hard stuff, I wasn’t up to par, but I was excited to learn.

The Literacy Narrative asked us to examine the ways in which our own literacy impacted us. I think, if I were to write it again, it would definitely need a part two: College Edition. I’ve discovered that my reading informs the way I analyze, informs the information I can draw on in order to make intelligent thoughts, and informs the way in which I interact with my audience. These three aspects of my literary life have influenced the totality of my college writing in, what I think, are positive ways. So here it is, the addendum to my literate life, the Literacy Narrative: College Edition and the various ways in which my views toward reading has saved my life over the last four years.


First, the reading I have done in college has informed the information I can draw on when I make arguments. For anyone who knows me, this particular aspect of my life manifests, not just in the physical writing and argument making I do, but in the oratory activities that seem to take up my weekend and any free time I could theoretically use to date. Yes, it was inevitable that I would talk about the Debate team. But hear me out for a second. Debating requires that its participants be well informed; it just makes the exercise less hair-pullingly frustrating when everyone comes to the table prepared. But debate also provides me a platform for discussing policies around those most controversial topics, an exercise I wasn’t comfortable with until I read Morality and War, Marx, excerpts from Frederick Douglas, Anzaldua, Didion, Foucault, Kant, and countless others. I can write and speak sensitively about race because I have read firsthand what racial discrimination can do, and I can choose to censor myself in times when I know that my own voice will never be enough because I’ve read other accounts that speak on the importance of lived experience.

#### <a id="lg2"></a> Learning Goal 2: Speaking and Listening are Valued as Part of Learning to Present Ideas

There is no time I feel more connected to the goals of my major when I am in Writing Fellow and Writing Colleague meetings. I have experienced firsthand the fact that speaking and listening are integral parts to understanding the needs and sensitivities of a student when teaching writing. Even so, with two full years of experience as a peer mentor under my belt, I’ve found that speaking and writing can also help me identify those struggles of students which I don’t always have the answers to.

When collecting artifacts for my portfolio, I stumbled upon a document titled “Baby Bird.” I opened it, not remembering having written anything, and found a brief recollection of my time as a Writing Colleague. The piece, more journal entry than anything else, rants about the line between teaching and spoon-feeding students, especially those who are least adjusted to the demands of college work. Importantly, though, the essay describes an event I’m not sure I’ve reconciled yet, two years later:

> “My baby bird came to me today in a Writing Colleague meeting. A big linebacker, assigned to a seemingly random Freshman Seminar called Introduction to the New Testament. Flat out confused, but not in the typical linebacker-given-an-essay-way. My baby bird was confused as to how he could possibly reconcile his very deep Catholic faith with the lessons we were learning in the class. We had studied discrepancies in the texts of the Gospel, as if they were historical fact and that naturally leads to questions. Big ones. The big ‘ole bird, in the middle of our meeting just looked at me and said ‘What am I supposed to do? I’m just so confused in this class. I’m a devout Catholic, born and raised, and this class is asking me questions I just can’t answer’” (Appendix 2)

I was supposed to know how to deal with this. In the Writing Colleague seminar, we had talked about how language and writing can impact the way our identities are formed. I myself really believed it when I said, “Anzaldua makes a very clear case for the legitimization of all her many languages. She does not feel strongly connected to her languages—she feels as if she is the sum of all her languages” (Appendix 11). My student-peers are, in many ways, the product of their culture and language. This particular student had come to me with an identity crisis born of the fact that he was expected to change his religious language into a critical, analytical one.

I’ve since experienced this elsewhere. In Writing Fellow meetings with English Language Learners I have simultaneously laughed with my peers over language barriers (“Pierogis, as it turns out, are not dumplings”) and sympathized when the barriers proved to be too much. I have done my best to avoid criticizing those parts of those language that are born in Chinese or French culture. I even once had a student that asked me “does this sound too Chinglish,” a word I had never heard before, because she was hyperaware of the doors that her language barrier could either open or close for her.

I know that, as a senior now, I’m supposed to be describing what I’ve learned, but what sticks out to me most is what I haven’t learned. I still don’t know how to walk the delicate balance between our academic expectations and students’ identities. The best I can do is make sure that I am listening, not only to stories, but to the distinct vocal and cultural patterns that make my peers unique. I can encourage “broken” English because I recognize the years of hard work that went into it. But when my peers come to me with the dichotomy between academia and their own identity, what do I do? I’m not sure I’ll ever have the answer.

#### <a id="lg3"></a> Learning Goal 3: Rhetorical Analysis of Audience and Purpose is Central to the Writing Task

I have, as a formal writer, written for three distinct reasons that I can identify. There is no piece of mine that ever displays just one purpose, but over the course of my career, I have written primarily to persuade, entertain and inform. The expectations of my audience have heavily shaped the way that these three goals manifest; the patience of my audience determines the rhetorical risks I can take. I have been asked to write in order to analyze, stretch my creative boundaries, and keep my job. I have been asked to censor myself on account of my vernacular, extraneous thoughts, and “too many dead Grandpa jokes.” Throughout the process of writing the thousands of words I’ve produced over the last four years, I have had to learn how to consider the needs of my audience over my own, analytically and rhetorically. Whether it was for an assigned paper, a creative writing exercise, or a blog for my summer internship, I have taken the various lessons my audience members have taught me and used it to streamline the purpose of my writing for the best reading experience.

As a particularly colloquial writer, I do not always consider the rhetorical needs of my audience above my own. If I can logically follow the line of persuasion, then any audience member should be able to as well. That is why it took me as late as my senior year to learn why common persuasive structures like “claims, evidence, and analysis” are so important when my purpose is to persuade. In the Power and Persuasion class I took in the Fall of 2015, I learned to edit my papers so that they reflected a line of thought which was easy to follow for the reader, despite the roundabout thought process I myself took to get there. For example, when I began a paragraph, “Even in her implication of who the Geek Feminism bloggers might be, York opts for gender-neutral pronouns. Of the pronouns used to discuss the bloggers (who are statistically likely not all women) and the people who might be at risk, the author intentionally uses non-gendered language to speak of the subjects” (Appendix 9). This is the type of claim which previously would have taken me an entire paragraph to arrive at, but I have learned to frontload the claim in order to map for the reader what my argument is.

When the expectations of my audience shift to entertainment, I find that my purpose as a writer also shifts to the amount of control I can exert over a narrative. In my Literary Journalism course, I got to experiment with pieces where I had to balance detail with the story, and pieces where I had to control the flow of emotion the reader felt toward my subject. In the first, I took a topic not many of my classmates were fully aware of, peaceful protests in Taiwan, and made it into an essay about the importance of peaceful protest in the digital age. I was extremely aware of the fact that my audience, primarily made up of my peers, didn’t have the perspective I did on the Taiwanese protests because I had heard much of it firsthand from a friend. I was stumped as to how I could connect something on the other side of the world, an event that required liberal amounts of detail to understand, to my peers. I found that my most powerful strategy was to highlight the ignorance of the world in order to explain the details needed to fight that ignorance. I am particularly proud of this passage, which reads,

> “The most public of the movements gather in squares outside government buildings, defying the world powers like Russia, China, and the US. The most desperate make the news—self-immolation was not a word in our vocabulary until monks started setting themselves on fire in Tibet. The smallest happen quickly, and are over just as fast. You do not notice.
>
> Taiwan, a country we are legally obligated to protect should China ever attempt to annex it, is a large spot of American ignorance—of those who have sworn to protect it. As communism rose in the mainland, democracy was forced to the little island; the tiny antithesis to what is now the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan still bravely asserts that it is the true Republic of China, and the people are fiercely protective of it, even as their status in the UN is slowly being chipped away by the economic and political might of the mainland. If the students feel the recent economic treaty with China is a threat to their democracy, then they are going to make their voices heard. They are peaceful for now, but while their President speaks only of the importance of the rule of law, they are growing desperate. Taiwan is sitting on the ancient line.” (Appendix 4)

It’s a lot of detail, but the strategy that I think was particularly valuable for my audience was the attempt to simultaneously empathize with any ignorance on the reader’s part, and use that empathy to spur an emotional response in favor of my message.

The most informal audience I’ve had to write for thus far, the most demanding audience I’ve written for, has been the readers of the Chegg Blog. I had to exercise every control I had over the vernacular of my work and the medium I published in, in order to inform my readers of the simultaneous benefits of Chegg as a “friend,” a “mentor,” and a storefront. Again, this purpose was intertwined with my desire to entertain my readers and to persuade them that Chegg was inexorably linked with the useful information I was providing them. There were also reminders of our audience everywhere in the office, from our motto, “students first,” to tweet correspondences we’d had that were taped to the wall (so, no pressure or anything). The result were a series of blog posts which, I feel, reflect my authenticity as a college student and writing-lover in every way. I used “calming GIFs” when I talked about anxiety, and humorous ones when I tried to get the really dull stuff, like writing tips, across (Appendix 6).  I was told, much to my chagrin, that I couldn’t use the most controversial parts of my humor, but I fought for the jokes that I felt would appeal to an audience of my peers.

I am most at home in my writing when the needs of my audience naturally line up with mine, but the work I am proudest of are the results of the challenges I have faced, which my different audiences have presented me with. I do not believe that I know how to exert complete rhetorical control over my audience, or that I would want to. My favorite works are those in which the audience members and I have discovered each other’s goals during the course of the work, and learned things from each other in the process.

#### <a id="lg4"></a> Learning Goal 4: Summary, Analysis, and Argument are Stressed as Important Academic Writing Modes

I understand the relationship between Summary, Analysis and Argument as akin to how evidence, explanation, and a thesis statement function together within a persuasive artifact. Most pieces of formal writing will contain aspects of all three, and even in those cases where an assignment expects pure summary or pure analysis, an argument will always be present. Firstly, there is always an argument in every form of writing we do, even if that argument is as simple as “The author is trying to persuade the reader that Emily Saeli should pass the first draft of her portfolio.” The things that a thesis sentence accomplishes are, to me, the same as saying “argument.” You must have a guiding claim you are trying to prove to the reader, and you must outline those claims early on in the artifact so that the reader can follow your line of thought. Argument can shape the way we form expectations about the author’s intentions, and the avenues of dissent we can form. In order for me to critique or disagree with anyone, in spoken or written rhetoric, I must first understand his or her argument. Otherwise, all I am critiquing are sound bites.

An example of my work which displays a lot of thought for the balance between my argument and argument of the evidence I am marshaling comes from Spring of 2015. In an essay where I was asked to make a persuasive claim about the argument structure of Marx, I created a thesis statement which highlighted how he developed certain terms to later make specific claims about the industrial reserve army later on. It reads: “In order for his concept to function, Marx had to develop the concepts of the prolongation of the working day and the division of labor in order to add depth and historical context to his metaphor of the industrial reserve army” (Appendix 8). On the most basic level, the creation of this thesis required that I understand the totality of Marx’s argument. The next step was putting that argument into a digestible piece for my reader. To do this, I needed to understand the analytical steps of my own goals in order to lay them out for the audience. In the Marx example this understanding manifested in an exploration of how the laborer could be so degraded in the eyes of the capitalist, and the way that Marx mocked that through his language.

Summary comes in many forms, but for me, it serves the function of “translating” a source so that the reader and the author are on the same page. Mere evidence is not enough when the reader and the author believe two entirely different things about how a quote functions out of context. Summary is a technique that I practiced in each of my Fall 2015 Grammatical Excursions for Grammar and Style. In my analysis of the poem “Atlantis” by Szymborska, I demonstrated how summary can identify the grammatical parts of a sentence before the important step of analyzing the effect that grammar has on the poem. This technique is displayed in the excursion when I say, “Stanza three creates a pattern of sentence pattern VI, V, VII, and an incomplete V. The final two lines: “‘They were meant to stand forever/We suppose’ could either say ‘We suppose they were meant to stand forever’ which would be a complete sentence V or ‘They were meant to stand forever’ which is both passive voice and sentence pattern VII" (Appendix 12). There is no information in this that is technically hidden to the reader, but I am bypassing the time and energy necessary to understand the intricacies of grammatical sentence patterns by simply summarizing them myself. The Grammatical Excursion expected me to provide evidence for analysis, but if the assignment were to ask for pure summary, it would still contain a guiding thought that I want the reader to take away.

![Why, why, why?!](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56bb9ae25559862434b7e08c/t/56c3769a4c2f85ca1307487b/1455650464491/?format=1000w)

Analysis is the extension of argument plus summary that allows us to prove those things which might not be immediately available to the reader. A paper I wrote in the Fall of 2013 displays a clear line of analysis which corresponds to the argument I am making in the paper. The Digital Rhetorical Analysis from “Digital Rhetoric” (Appendix 7) argues that the popular online game League of Legends is not an activity that can be fairly accessed by all, varying on the basis of class, race and gender. The initial challenge was how to compare my source, a visual thing, with the textbook, which would provide me a metric for deciding the fairness of the activity. The analysis that takes place on the micro scale is something that picks apart individual game aspects, but on the macro scale, as the goal of this assignment, requires that I break down the game itself within the realm of fairness as proposed by our textbook author.  One individual aspect I chose was customization, referred colloquially as “skins.” The analysis occurs clearly when I say, “While skins don’t effect in-game performance at all, they are available exclusively to those who have the means to pay for them. Since customization is so important to members of the gaming community, the act of setting apart separate skins for a wealthier group of people contributes to the first in a trend of inequality amongst gamers.” Analysis is important to the balance between Summary, Analysis and Argument because it moves academia forward. Analysis can draw new results or claims from ancient texts, and it is the thing which, depending on its rigor, allows us to agree or disagree with one another.

#### <a id="lg6"></a> Learning Goal 6: Collaboration is Practiced as Integral to the Writing Process

True collaborative experiences, that is, those times when more than one author is equally responsible for the final product of his or her work, seem to be rare in my writing. It is not for a lack of collaborative effort (I am no “Lone Wolf”), but rather for a lack of saved examples. The best collaborative experiences I have come from group-work, with very little “finished product” to show years later. The best collaborative example I have is the 2013 Writing Colleague handbook, which I had a hand in creating, but no part in the assembly. I think the best working example I have of collaboration comes through experiences of peer review and Writing Fellow meetings with students.

Peer review is an important part of any revision, because it allow the author to simultaneously see the strengths and weaknesses of an argument, as well as any rhetorical weaknesses in communication. I especially value peer review because, even though I can appraise my own analysis and argument, I will never be able to predict those parts of an essay which were hard to understand for an outside reader. In the example of Brief Analysis 4 (Appendix 9), peer review helped me become aware of the places in my work where my line of thought needed to be made clearer. For example, my peers brought it to my attention in BA 4 that I was referring to the EFF without first explaining what the Electronic Frontier Foundation was; it was information I had taken for granted. I was then able to fix the situation by explaining the acronym, saying that “The EFF, which hosts a variety of artifacts, also produces a blog called “Deep Links” and generally providing more context for the argument I was to make.

My Writing Fellow meetings do not require that I share the same amount of responsibility for a piece as the student writing it, but I do feel a certain stake in their work nevertheless. In every meeting there is a collaboration of the student’s work and effort and my own understanding of writing and rhetoric. For example, if I were to have a meeting with a student on an essay about politics, the revision plan she would leave with would be the result of a collaborative effort between me, her, and her work. I could contribute analytical, grammatical, or argumentative advice to the knowledge that the student has already presented. Importantly, and this is arguably the most frustrating aspect of my job, the collaboration that takes place in a Writing Fellow meeting requires that the student follow the revision plan we’ve created together. Otherwise, any collaborative effort that went into the plan is moot.

#### <a id="lg7"></a> Learning Goal 7: Editing and Polishing are Necessary Steps in Producing a Final Written Text

The process that produced my first piece of published work was not an easy one. Galatea was born as “Android” which was born out of the sappy kind of heartbreak that you really don’t want to hear about (Appendix 10). It was physically challenging (see: crappy romance), it was intellectually challenging, and then when it was all out on paper, I was left with the challenge of changing it. My revision goals were to preserve the emotional feeling that inspired the story, and, selfishly, to make it into a piece UEA would want to publish.

The first step I took after the first draft of Android was to find a way to preserve the emotional feelings which had inspired the piece. I had chosen to leave out any description of Raven’s love interests because it felt too personal, and because there weren’t any moments that felt right to introduce it. After the first draft, many of my peers expressed a desire to know more about the Andis. I took this audience reaction and pushed it – what kind of details did I want to include, and would it effect the space I had created between the reader and Raven? Ultimately, I decided to interrupt Miranda’s thought in order to make it feel like there wasn’t really a beginning or an end to this process for Raven. The question of distance was also an important one for me. I wanted the reader to empathize with Raven from the point of view of a third person observer, so I did my best to represent her thoughts only through the things she said out loud.

While I’m appraising the final product, I want to highlight the parts of the story that were not changed in order to emphasize the clearest goal I had when I began. The opening paragraph of Galatea was the first thing I wrote, and probably the last thing I would change. While I wrote that passage, my main character developed as gentle, sensitive and sentimental, aspects that moved the piece forward. It is the paragraph that reassured me that my story concept was worth investigating, and the thing that assured me that Raven was real.

As for the fact that I wanted my piece to be wanted, there isn’t much that can be analyzed there. I took out, at the recommendation of an HWS faculty advisor, the quote that began Android: “The opposite of love is not hate, its indifference. The opposite of beauty is not ugliness, its indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, its indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, but indifference between life and death. -Elie Weisel.” The quote meant a lot to me, sentimentally, but it meant very little to my reader, especially given the context of the piece. It also meant very little to the faculty member, who represented the demographic I was trying to impress. The quote got axed, but I got published. My final product still feels like something alien, albeit one that pleasantly surprises me each time I read it, but I credit that feeling to the intense revision I put “Galatea” through before she was ready. It is not the impulsive emotional outburst Android began as, but an emotional appeal to an audience that has hopefully felt the same heartbreak that I have.

#### <a id="lg8"></a> Learning Goal 8: Multiple Research Techniques are Central to Writing Tasks

I tell my Writing Fellow students that research is the thing which prevents them from looking ignorant or silly when they are presenting an argument. Research techniques that have been helpful to me include doing the assigned readings, finding outside sources, asking friends, and being informed on the subject as much as possible outside of class. Having multiple research techniques is important so that you, or any writer, never creates an argument in a vacuum from possible supportive or dissenting evidence out there.

![What's up with all deez books?](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56bb9ae25559862434b7e08c/t/56c376e2b6aa6020e241c3e7/1455650535911/?format=1000w)

In an article on writing tips I wrote for the Chegg Blog (Appendix 6), I joked: “It seems obvious, but by the second half of freshman year, many students have forgotten to read the ‘required’ texts, much less the ‘optional’ ones. How are you supposed to write smart, unique thoughts on the subject if you know nothing about it?” It seems like a truism that research for a class begin with the assigned text, but lived experience has taught me otherwise. I think the issue was best summed up when I continued:

> "Look at it this way, your teachers expect you to write essays that demonstrate your ability to critically think about the material you’ve been given. On the one hand, they’re preparing you to think critically about situations you’ll be presented with later on in your education, but on the other hand, they don’t want to read the same essay over and over again. You’ll stand out in class if you write on unique topics, and the only way to do that is to read. the. book."

This is advice that has applied to me, my peers, and countless of my Writing Fellow meetings. One of the largest changes in research that has occurred over the last four years is the fact that I actually start with the sources the teacher has provided me with now.

Finding outside sources is, for me, the most obvious method that comes to mind for research techniques. As a senior, I am equally familiar with the physical stacks of the library and the virtual stacks of JSTOR. When consulting outside sources, I think it is of tantamount importance to create a bibliography as you go in order to reference inspirations you had later. I also would encourage anyone doing research to consider expanding their horizons of what counts as research. In my Literary Journalism piece “Buffalove” (Appendix 5) I describe the series of phone calls I made to the various New York State offices that maintain the side of the highway. It is important to note that, in this instance, a lack of information served my narrative just as strongly as any answer would have; the golden buffalo is missing, and it’s telling that I never got an answer as to why.

Asking friends and peers is an important research technique for me because it allows me to both gauge the level of understanding of my average reader, aka how much context I’m going to have to provide, and the level of controversy surrounding the topic. The only context I have for the sensitivity that is the topic of abortion lies in the disagreement and passion of my peers. With this knowledge, I can be more prepared to address what I know to be a sensitive topic because I am at less of a risk of alienating my audience. Finding peer sources became important in the research I did for the Digital Rhetorical Analysis paper (Appendix 7) because it informed the emphasis I could put on the importance to individual gamers. When I talked about “easter eggs,” and Lore, I did so in full knowledge of the fact that my friend Eric had much of the League of Legends Lore memorized. When I discussed the Tribunal, a phenomenon I had never experienced, I gauged whether or not players thought it was fair and effective by simply asking them.

Finally, I cannot overstate the importance of being informed as much as possible on a research topic outside of class. While it isn’t a research strategy that can happen in the 1-3 weeks before an assignment is due, any prior knowledge I have on the subject will heavily influence the way I speak or write about that topic. If I had to point to one thing that marks the difference between my freshman and senior year writing, it is the knowledge base that I draw from, the far superior starting point I have. Debate has taught me to read the news, sure, but writing and rhetoric, given that we cover so many things in our exploration of the craft, has taught me to draw on the sources I’ve read in other classes to influence the final product of my work. My piece on peaceful protests in Taiwan (Appendix 4) does not explicitly reference earlier readings I did in International Relations classes on sovereignty, but those ideas are reflected nonetheless in the finished product.

If we expect our writers to produce interesting, creative and well-rounded thoughts, we must first encourage them to access information by any means possible. I am a fan of traditional sources like the course textbooks and formal, external research, but I also have found value in informal research like asking peers for their opinions and drawing on sources from other classes.

#### <a id="lg9"></a> Learning Goal 9: Understanding Why Writing Choices are Made is as Important as Making Them

When it comes to most writing I do, I tend to avoid eliciting emotion from my audience. Most of my work is analytical by nature of that fact that it is produced within academia, and there really isn’t a space for emotion in analysis. In those instances where I myself am emotional about the topic, I can fall into the trap of getting too emotional, too invested in the topic, to the point where the reader feels left out of the loop. In my final piece for Literary Journalism in the Spring of my sophomore year, in the culmination of several works I was already immensely proud of, I took on a subject while had the potential to make me pretty emotional: my hometown. I knew of my own shortcomings where emotional writing was concerned, so I set out to write a piece which would lead my readers on a controlled version of an emotional journey similar to my own.

 I wanted my classmates to empathize with a town that is frequently referred to as a desolate and worthless place. The reactions I wanted to solicit were ones of outrage that slowly transitioned into hope. This effect did not come easily. I first chose to introduce my audience to a song, which rhythmically drove the transitions of my piece. I began with, “Fifteen years on the Erie Canal/ We've hauled some barges in our day/ Filled with lumber, coal, and hay/ And we know every inch of the way/ From Albany to Buffalo.” This is a song which is taught in every elementary school in my area, as readily as the importance of a snow-blower or chicken wings. The first challenge was the length. I originally started with the entire song, three stanzas worth, but due to the fact that most of my classmates weren’t aware of it, my own familiarity wasn’t enough to overcome the wall of text. I was forced to cut many of my favorite details of the song, and much of the nostalgia that came with it, in the revision process (Appendix 5).

I used the song to maintain a narrative thread throughout my piece, one with rhythm that I hoped would center my reader even as I wandered through the tangential spaces of my hometown. After I was done with each section, I pulled the reader back to the point, the pride that Buffalo still displays, by referencing a piece of its history. For example, when I wanted to talk about the details I saw changing in the landscape of my home, I began the section with, “And we know every inch of the way…” Unlike the song, I set off these transitional phrases with ellipses to remind the reader that the song itself was a continuation of that thought I started out with that tied the piece together in the background.

I also tried to empathize with any reader who wasn’t familiar with my home, but with narratives of a broken city. I called my beloved city things like, “a wrinkled former beauty queen, back straight, trying to preserve her remaining dignity” and I described my love “like a mother loves her drug addict son” (Appendix 5). Importantly, I admitted my own fault in my love for Buffalo – I had once seen a broken city too, before I had my mind changed. I did this to start the audience on equal emotional footing. With these few phrases, I could elicit similar responses from people who were familiar and unfamiliar with Buffalo, alike. This made the emotional transition I was going for easier, because I knew where everyone was starting from.

I made the narrative choices I did both to instill empathy in my readers who saw nothing but a crumbling city and to revive a sense of hope when I finally transitioned emotionally. I said, “I had gone my whole short life not knowing what ‘the city of Buffalo’ really meant, but my first job in Allentown started opening my eyes to the kinds of strength and magic that could be found there” (Appendix 5).  Now, all that was left to prove were the logical reasons why my readers should share my opinion of my city.

My writing leaks emotion from every word in the final paragraphs of “Buffalove.” I say things like, “My city…brings tears to my eyes and protest to my lips. To those who’d say nothing good comes out of Buffalo, I say great. We’re keeping the best for ourselves.” I’ve arrived at my emotional treasure chest, and I want my audience to feel the same way I do.

I can’t speak for any of my readers as to how they feel about Buffalo now. Maybe my piece worked for a short time, maybe it didn’t at all. I am confident in the natural flow of emotion which I have wrested control over in this piece, and it is because of this control that I am so confident in the rhetorical choices I made.
