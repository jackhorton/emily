Here is the collection of essays I wrote as a senior Writing and Rhetoric major. They represent my responses to a series of prompts, as well as my struggles and experiences as a Writing and Rhetoric Major over my four years at HWS. 

The Appendix contains the portfolio of work I reference and draw from in these essays. I highly reccommend you explore it, and see for yourself how I've grown as a writer.
